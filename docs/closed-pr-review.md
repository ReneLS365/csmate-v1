# Review of Recently Closed Pull Requests

This document summarizes the recently closed pull requests listed in the prompt and highlights whether any appear important or repeat previously merged work.

## Potentially Important Closures

| PR | Title | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #17 | Ensure canonical E-Komplet headers override saved mappings | Closed without merge. Given that similar fixes shipped in merged PR #18, the remaining changes here are likely superseded. |
| #11 | Fix E-komplet import mapping fallback and add regression test | Closed. The regression test and fallback adjustments seem to have been merged earlier in PR #7, suggesting this attempt was superseded. |

## Likely Superseded or Duplicate Attempts

Several closed PRs appear to iterate on the same feature before the final merged version:

- **Handle TIME rows in CSV import** (#8, #10, and #11): Two closed attempts (#8 and #10) preceded the ultimately merged solution in PR #14, which addressed safe property access for time rows.
- **Fix E-komplet import mapping fallback** (#11 vs. merged #7 and #18): The closed PR revisited logic already merged earlier, and the latest merged PR #18 includes the canonical header behavior.

## Already Addressed in Merged PRs

Most functionality from the closed PRs has been incorporated into merged work:

- **Tab navigation and legacy browsers**: Finalized in merged PR #18.
- **Vitest coverage dependency**: Delivered in merged PR #16.
- **Candidate material source lookup and normalization**: Completed in merged PRs #14 and #15.

## Conclusion

All closed PRs listed either targeted functionality already delivered in merged PRs (#7, #14, #18) or represented interim iterations. No outstanding important changes remain exclusive to the closed pull requests.

## Verification Steps

To confirm the repository remains healthy after this review, the following checks were executed:

- `npm run lint` to ensure the source files continue to satisfy the configured ESLint rules.
- `npm test` to execute the Vitest suite, verifying the regression coverage for the E-Komplet import flow and related calculators.
